# Searching Operation
## Linear Search || Binary Search || Insert, Delete Operations

## Time and Space Complexity

### Insert, Delete Operations : T.C = O(n) and S.C = O(1)
Best case: At the end -> T.C = O(1) S.C = O(1) / Worst case: At the start -> T.C = O(n) and S.C = O(1)

### Linear Search ( -> in unsorted array) : T.C = O(n) and S.C = O(1)
Best case: At the end -> T.C = O(1) S.C = O(1) / Worst case: At the start -> T.C = O(n) and S.C = O(1)

### Binary Search ( -> in sorted Array ) :
